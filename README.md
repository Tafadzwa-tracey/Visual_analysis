This [project](https://github.com/yuzhang21/dataviz-project-templateA-proposal) use [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) and [React]( https://reactjs.org/) to display an interactive four-panel view for visualization. 
The Data used is the [ILINet Flu Surveillance Dataset](https://gist.github.com/yuzhang21/afd1af3a28631a12dfd8eee37520309f) from [ILINet Flu Surveillance Report](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#ILIMap). The original data is downloaded from the webpage: 
[CDC FluView Interactive](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm).

**Four Panel View** The visualization is composed of 4 panels. 
* The first line plot displays annual average patient visits percentage or other values from the dataset on weekly bases. It demonstrates the pattern for different years.
